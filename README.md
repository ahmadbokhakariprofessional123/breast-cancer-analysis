# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors as **Malignant** or **Benign** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end data science workflow, covering data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation, with a focus on real-world healthcare applications.

## Problem Statement
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early and accurate detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates.

This project uses machine learning models to assist in early detection by analysing cell nucleus features such as radius, texture, smoothness, and concavity, and predicting whether a tumor is cancerous or non-cancerous.
